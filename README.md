# (Re-)Learning Node.js

I've used **Node.js** a number of times already and I'm fairly familiar with it. However, I decided in Jan 2016 to take an online course and re-learn it from the beginning, just to cover any gaps that may exist in my knowledge and hopefully learn something new about it!

Anyway, this repo is just to move code easily between my different machines as I move around, so there's nothing exciting in here!

**Update - 8th Feb 2016:** now that I've completed the course, this repo is "dormant".
